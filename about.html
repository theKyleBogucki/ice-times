      <h1>Welcome to IceTimes, a website designed to be a central source for finding skate times at nearby rinks.</h1>


      <h2>How we got started</h2>

       <p>A few months ago, a co-worker and fellow hockey player and I were trying to coordinate getting together to play a little pick-up hockey together. There are a handful of rinks between him and I and we had to search each rink's schedule to find a time that would work for us. That may have proven to be the most painful experience ever. Searching for rinks, trying to navigate websites only to come across PDF files that were buried among other links. We felt it was time to solve that problem.</p>


      <h2>Our Goal</h2>

       <p>We want to make it as easy as possible for you to get on the ice, whether it before a friendly game of pick-up hockey or a stick 'n' shoot. This project is extremely small in scale to start but we envision IceTimes reaching nationally and around the world. We want to partner with skaters and rink coordinators to help us build momentum. We want to be come the go-to resource for amateur hockey players.</p>


      <h1>Thank you!</h1>
